## ANALYSIS: What Makes Each Mode Unique?

### Major Modes vs Ionian:
- **Dorian**: Only mode with i + IV
- **Phrygian**: Only mode with ♭II  
- **Lydian**: Only mode with ♯iv°, also has II
- **Mixolydian**: Only mode with I + ♭VII
- **Aeolian**: Has i + ♭VII (but ♭VII pulls to relative major)
- **Locrian**: Only mode with i° (diminished tonic)

### Harmonic Minor Modes vs Natural Minor:
- **Harmonic Minor**: Has V (major dominant) - needs i + V pairing
- **Locrian ♮6**: Has VI (natural 6th) - needs i° + VI pairing 
- **Ionian ♯5**: Has ♯V+ (augmented 5th) - needs I + ♯V+ pairing
- **Dorian ♯4**: Has ♯IV (raised 4th) - needs i + ♯IV pairing
- **Phrygian Dominant**: Major tonic with ♭II - needs I + ♭II pairing
- **Lydian ♯2**: Has ♯II (raised 2nd) - needs I + ♯II pairing
- **Super Locrian**: Extremely altered - needs i° + ♭II for stability

### Melodic Minor Modes vs Natural Minor:
- **Melodic Minor**: Has V (major dominant) - needs i + V pairing
- **Dorian ♭2**: Has ♭II but also VI - needs i + ♭II or i + VI pairing
- **Lydian Augmented**: Has ♯V+ (augmented 5th) - needs I + ♯V+ pairing
- **Lydian Dominant**: Has ♯IV and ♭VII - should use I + ♭VII (more practical)
- **Mixolydian ♭6**: Has ♭VI (flat 6th) - needs I + ♭VI pairing
- **Locrian ♮2**: Has II (natural 2nd) - needs i° + II pairing
- **Altered/Super Locrian**: Same as harmonic minor version

### "Gets Used" Test - Common Progressions:

**Harmonic Minor Modes:**
- **Harmonic Minor**: i-V-i (classical minor), i-♭VI-V-i
- **Locrian ♮6**: i°-VI-i° (rare but VI provides stability)
- **Ionian ♯5**: I-♯V+-I (floating, impressionistic)
- **Dorian ♯4**: i-♯IV-i (bright Lydian color in minor)
- **Phrygian Dominant**: I-♭II-I (Spanish/Middle Eastern), very common
- **Lydian ♯2**: I-♯II-I (exotic, less common)
- **Super Locrian**: i°-♭II (for stability, rarely used)

**Melodic Minor Modes:**
- **Melodic Minor**: i-V-i (classical), i-IV-V-i
- **Dorian ♭2**: i-♭II-i (Phrygian feel) vs i-VI-i (brighter)
- **Lydian Augmented**: I-♯V+-I (floating), I-II-♯V+-I
- **Lydian Dominant**: I-♭VII-I (jazz standard), I-II-♭VII-I
- **Mixolydian ♭6**: I-♭VI-I (exotic), I-♭VII-♭VI-I
- **Locrian ♮2**: i°-II-i° (brighter than regular Locrian)
- **Altered**: i°-♭II (for stability)

## PRACTICAL CHARACTERISTIC PAIRS:

Based on "gets used" + "creates modal sound":

### Major Modes:
- **Dorian**: i + IV ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Phrygian**: i + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Lydian**: I + II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Mixolydian**: I + ♭VII ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Aeolian**: i + iv ✅ (CORRECTED from v)
- **Locrian**: i° + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)

### Harmonic Minor Modes:
- **Harmonic Minor**: Uses functional harmony (not modal pairing) ✅
- **Locrian ♮6**: i° + VI ✅ (CORRECTED from ♭II to VI)
- **Ionian ♯5**: I + ♯V+ ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Dorian ♯4**: i + ♯IV ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Phrygian Dominant**: I + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Lydian ♯2**: I + ♯II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Super Locrian**: i° + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)

### Melodic Minor Modes:
- **Melodic Minor**: i + V ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Dorian ♭2**: i + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Lydian Augmented**: I + ♯V+ ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Lydian Dominant**: I + ♭VII ✅ (CORRECTED from ♯IV)
- **Mixolydian ♭6**: i + ♭VI ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Locrian ♮2**: i° + II ✅ (Currently correct in code)
- **Altered/Super Locrian**: i° + ♭II ✅ (Currently correct in code)

## CORRECTIONS NEEDED:

### 1. Locrian ♮6 (Harmonic Minor Mode 2):
- **Current**: i° + ♭II (same as regular Locrian)
- **Should be**: i° + VI (the natural 6th is what distinguishes this mode)
- **Why**: The VI chord provides major brightness that differentiates from regular Locrian

### 2. Lydian Dominant (Melodic Minor Mode 4):
- **Current**: I + ♯IV (theoretically correct but harsh)
- **Should be**: I + ♭VII (practical jazz usage)
- **Why**: More usable in real-world applications, maintains modal character

These corrections ensure all modes have characteristic pairs that both highlight their unique intervals AND get used in practice.
