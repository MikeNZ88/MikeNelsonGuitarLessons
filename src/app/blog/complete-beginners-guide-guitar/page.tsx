            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 1: Choosing Your First Guitar</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The most important decision for any beginner guitarist is choosing the right instrument. You don't need to spend a fortune, but you do need a guitar that's comfortable to play and stays in tune.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Acoustic vs Electric Guitar for Beginners</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Acoustic guitars</strong> are often recommended for beginners because they're self-contained - no amplifier needed. They're great for learning chords, strumming patterns, and developing finger strength. However, the strings can be harder to press down initially.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Electric guitars</strong> have lighter strings that are easier on your fingers, making them potentially better for beginners who struggle with finger strength. You'll need an amplifier, but basic practice amps are affordable and often come in starter packages.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
              <p className="text-blue-900 font-semibold">
                <strong>My Recommendation:</strong> Choose based on the music you love. Want to play campfire songs or acoustic covers? Go acoustic. Dream of playing rock, blues, or pop music? Start with electric. You'll practice more if you're excited about the sounds you're making.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 2: Essential Gear (What You Actually Need)</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The guitar industry loves selling accessories to beginners, but you don't need much to start learning effectively.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Must-Have Items</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Guitar picks</strong> - Start with medium thickness (0.7-0.8mm). Buy several as you'll lose them.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Tuner</strong> - A clip-on tuner or smartphone app. Your guitar must be in tune to sound good.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Guitar stand or wall hanger</strong> - Keep your guitar visible and easily accessible. You'll practice more when it's not hidden in a case.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Nice-to-Have Items</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Capo</strong> - Allows you to play songs in different keys without learning new chord shapes. Very useful for beginners.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Metronome</strong> - Helps develop timing. Many free apps available.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Extra strings</strong> - Strings break, especially when you're learning to tune. Have a spare set ready.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 3: Your First Chords and Songs</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Most beginner guitar methods start with chords because they allow you to play complete songs quickly. Here's the most efficient learning path:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Essential Beginner Chords</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Learn these five chords first - they appear in thousands of songs:
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>G major</strong> - Often the easiest chord for beginners to form clearly
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>C major</strong> - A fundamental chord that teaches good finger positioning
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>D major</strong> - Uses only three fingers, building confidence
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>E minor</strong> - The easiest chord to play, using just two fingers
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>A minor</strong> - Similar shape to E minor, easy to learn after Em
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your First Songs</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Once you can play these chords cleanly and switch between them, you can play hundreds of songs. Start with these beginner-friendly classics:
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>"Wonderwall" by Oasis</strong> - Uses Em, C, D, G (four of your five chords)
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>"Horse with No Name" by America</strong> - Just Em and D, perfect for practicing chord changes
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>"Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles</strong> - Em and C, great for strumming practice
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>"Bad Moon Rising" by CCR</strong> - Uses D, A, G for a different chord progression
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Step 4: How to Practice Effectively</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Quality practice is more important than quantity. Here's how to make the most of your practice time:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 15-Minute Practice Session</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Short, focused practice sessions are more effective than long, unfocused ones. Here's a proven 15-minute structure:
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Minutes 1-3: Warm up</strong> - Simple finger exercises or easy chord changes
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Minutes 4-8: Chord practice</strong> - Work on new chords or difficult transitions
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Minutes 9-12: Song practice</strong> - Play through songs you're learning
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Minutes 13-15: Fun time</strong> - Play something you enjoy or experiment freely
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Learning from others' mistakes can save you months of frustration. Here are the most common beginner pitfalls:
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Not tuning your guitar</strong> - An out-of-tune guitar will sound terrible no matter how well you play. Tune before every practice session.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Trying to learn too much too fast</strong> - Master a few chords well rather than learning many poorly.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Only playing when you "feel like it"</strong> - Consistent daily practice, even for 10 minutes, beats sporadic long sessions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">When to Consider Guitar Lessons</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              While you can learn guitar on your own, lessons can accelerate your progress and help you avoid developing bad habits.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Consider lessons if you:</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Want personalized feedback on your technique
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Need structure and accountability
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Want to learn music theory alongside practical skills
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              • Have specific goals (like playing in a band or performing)
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Online vs In-Person Lessons</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Both formats have advantages. Online lessons offer convenience and often lower cost, while in-person lessons provide immediate feedback and hands-on correction of technique issues.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Your 30-Day Beginner Guitar Plan</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Here's a realistic month-by-month progression for dedicated beginners practicing 15-20 minutes daily:
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Staying Motivated on Your Guitar Journey</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Learning guitar is a marathon, not a sprint. Here's how to maintain motivation through the inevitable challenges:
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Set small, achievable goals</strong> - "Learn one new chord this week" rather than "become a great guitarist"
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Record yourself playing</strong> - You'll be surprised how much you've improved when you compare recordings
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Play with others when possible</strong> - Even simple jam sessions can be incredibly motivating
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>Remember why you started</strong> - Keep that initial excitement alive by regularly playing songs you love
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Next Steps: Beyond the Basics</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Once you're comfortable with basic chords and can play simple songs, you might want to explore:
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Barre chords (opens up many more songs)
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Basic music theory (understanding why chords work together)
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Lead guitar techniques (bending, hammer-ons, pull-offs)
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              • Different musical styles (blues, rock, folk, classical)
